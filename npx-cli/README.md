Behind every "thinking..." spinner, Claude is spawning sub-agents, calling MCP servers, running skills, firing hooks — and you can't see any of it.

**You're paying $200/mo for Claude Code. You deserve a dashboard.**

<div align="center">

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.claudeview.ai/install.sh | sh
```

**One command. Every session visible. Real-time.**

## How It Works

On first run, `npx claude-view` downloads a platform-specific Rust binary (~10 MB) from GitHub Releases. The binary is cached at `~/.claude-view/` so subsequent runs start instantly.

Your sessions, code, and prompts stay on your machine — claude-view reads and indexes them entirely locally. To guide development, official builds (this npm package and the install script) can send **anonymous, content-free usage analytics** when you opt in (which features are used, app version, OS — never code, prompts, paths, or session content). Telemetry is off by default; opt in with `CLAUDE_VIEW_TELEMETRY=1` or the Settings → Telemetry toggle. Builds from source send nothing. See the [Privacy Policy](https://claudeview.ai/privacy).

| Env Variable | Default | Description |
