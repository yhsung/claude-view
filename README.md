## What Is claude-view?

claude-view is an open-source dashboard that monitors every Claude Code session on your machine — live agents, past conversations, costs, sub-agents, hooks, tool calls — in one place. Rust backend, React frontend, ~10 MB binary. Zero config, zero accounts, local-first — your sessions, code and prompts never leave your machine ([anonymous usage analytics](#privacy--telemetry) in official builds only when you opt in; source builds send nothing).

**50+ releases. 85 MCP tools. 9 skills. One `npx claude-view`.**

---

## Live Monitor

See every running session at a glance. No more terminal tab-switching.

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Session cards** | Each card shows the last message, model, cost, and status — instantly know what every agent is working on |
| **Multi-session chat** | Open sessions side-by-side in VS Code-style tabs (dockview). Drag to split horizontally or vertically |
| **Context gauge** | Real-time context window fill per session — see which agents are in the danger zone before they hit the limit |
| **Cache countdown** | Know exactly when prompt cache expires so you can time messages to save tokens |
| **Cost tracking** | Per-session and aggregate spend with token breakdown — hover for input/output/cache split by model |
| **Sub-agent tree** | See the full tree of spawned agents, their status, costs, and what tools they're calling |
| **Notification sounds** | Get pinged when a session finishes, errors, or needs your input — stop polling terminals |
| **Multiple views** | Grid, List, Kanban, Monitor, or Harness mode — pick what fits your workflow |
| **Kanban swimlanes** | Group sessions by project or branch — visual swimlane layout for multi-project workflows |
| **Recently closed** | Sessions that end appear in "Recently Closed" instead of vanishing — persists across server restarts |
| **Queued messages** | Messages waiting in the queue show as pending bubbles with a "Queued" badge |
| **SSE-driven** | All live data pushed via Server-Sent Events — eliminates stale-cache risks entirely |

---

## Chat & Conversation

Read, search, and interact with any session — live or historical.

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Unified live chat** | History and real-time messages in a single scrollable conversation — no tab-switching |
| **Developer mode** | Toggle between Chat and Developer views per session. Developer mode shows tool cards, event cards, hook metadata, and the full execution trace with filter chips |
| **Full conversation browser** | Every session, every message, fully rendered with markdown and code blocks |
| **Tool call visualization** | See file reads, edits, bash commands, MCP calls, skill invocations — not just text |
| **Compact / verbose toggle** | Skim the conversation or drill into every tool call |
| **Thread view** | Follow agent conversations with sub-agent hierarchies and indented threading |
| **Hook events inline** | Pre/post tool hooks rendered as conversation blocks — see hooks firing alongside the conversation |
| **Export** | Markdown export for context resumption or sharing |
| **Bulk select & archive** | Select multiple sessions for batch archiving with persistent filter state |
| **Encrypted sharing** | Share any session via E2E encrypted link — AES-256-GCM, zero server trust, key lives only in the URL fragment |

---

## Agent Internals

Claude Code does a lot behind `"thinking..."` that never shows in your terminal. claude-view exposes all of it.

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Sub-agent conversations** | Full tree of spawned agents, their prompts, outputs, and per-agent cost/token breakdown |
| **MCP server calls** | Which MCP tools are being invoked and their results |
| **Skill / hook / plugin tracking** | Which skills fired, which hooks ran, what plugins are active |
| **Hook event recording** | Dual-channel hook capture (live WebSocket + JSONL backfill) — every event recorded and browsable, even for past sessions |
| **Session source badges** | Each session shows how it was started: Terminal, VS Code, Agent SDK, or other entrypoints |
| **Worktree branch drift** | Detects when git worktree branches diverge — shown in live monitor and history |
| **@File mention chips** | `@filename` references extracted and shown as chips — hover for full path |
| **Tool use timeline** | Action log of every tool_use/tool_result pair with timing |
| **Error surfacing** | Errors bubble up to the session card — no buried failures |
| **Raw message inspector** | Drill into any message's raw JSON when you need the full picture |

---

## Search

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Rust grep search** | Search across all sessions — messages, tool calls, file paths. Powered by ripgrep-core over raw JSONL |
| **Filtered search engine** | SQLite pre-filter + grep search — one endpoint without maintaining a separate session search index |
| **Project & branch filters** | Scope to the project or branch you're working on right now |
| **Command palette** | <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> to jump between sessions, switch views, find anything |

---

## How It's Built

| | |
|---|---|
| **Fast** | Rust backend with SIMD-accelerated JSONL parsing, memory-mapped I/O — indexes thousands of sessions in seconds |
| **Real-time** | File watcher + SSE + multiplexed WebSocket with heartbeat, event replay, and crash recovery |
| **Tiny** | ~10 MB download, ~27 MB on disk. No runtime dependencies, no background daemons |
| **Local-first** | Your sessions, code & prompts never leave your machine. Official builds send anonymous feature-usage analytics only when you opt in (no content, ever) — opt in with `CLAUDE_VIEW_TELEMETRY=1`; source builds send nothing. Zero required accounts |
| **Zero config** | `npx claude-view` and you're done. No API keys, no setup, no accounts |
| **FSM-driven** | Chat sessions run on a finite state machine with explicit phases and typed events — deterministic, race-free |

<details>
<summary><strong>The Numbers</strong></summary>
<br>

Measured on an M-series Mac with 1,493 sessions across 26 projects:

| Metric | claude-view | Typical Electron dashboard |
|--------|:-----------:|:--------------------------:|
| **Download** | **~10 MB** | 150-300 MB |
| **On disk** | **~27 MB** | 300-500 MB |
| **Startup** | **< 500 ms** | 3-8 s |
| **RAM (full index)** | **~50 MB** | 300-800 MB |
| **Index 1,500 sessions** | **< 1 s** | N/A |
| **Runtime deps** | **0** | Node.js + Chromium |

Key techniques: SIMD pre-filter (`memchr`), memory-mapped JSONL parsing, ripgrep-core search over raw JSONL, zero-copy slices from mmap through parse to response.

## How It Compares

| Tool | Category | Stack | Size | Live monitor | Multi-session chat | Search | Analytics | MCP tools |
|------|----------|-------|:----:|:------------:|:------------------:|:------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| **[claude-view](https://github.com/tombelieber/claude-view)** | Monitor + workspace | Rust | **~10 MB** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **85** |
| [opcode](https://github.com/winfunc/opcode) | GUI + session manager | Tauri 2 | ~13 MB | Partial | No | No | Yes | No |
| [ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage) | CLI usage tracker | TypeScript | ~600 KB | No | No | No | CLI | No |
| [CodePilot](https://github.com/op7418/CodePilot) | Desktop chat UI | Electron | ~140 MB | No | No | No | No | No |
| [claude-run](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/claude-run) | History viewer | TypeScript | ~500 KB | Partial | No | Basic | No | No |

> Chat UIs (CodePilot, CUI, claude-code-webui) are interfaces *for* Claude Code. claude-view is a dashboard that watches your existing terminal sessions. They're complementary.

---

## Privacy & Telemetry

claude-view is local-first. **Your sessions, code, prompts, file paths and project names never leave your machine** (the only exception is the encrypted Share feature, which you trigger explicitly).

To guide development with real data — instead of guessing — **official builds can send anonymous usage analytics when you opt in**. This is how the prebuilt binary is distributed:

| Build | Telemetry |
|-------|-----------|
| `npx claude-view` · `curl … install.sh \| sh` (official binary) | **Off by default** — anonymous, opt in anytime via Settings or `CLAUDE_VIEW_TELEMETRY=1` |
| Built from source (`cargo build`) | **Off, always** — no analytics key is compiled in; there is no code path that can send |
| `CLAUDE_VIEW_TELEMETRY=0` or CI detected | **Off** — hard override, beats everything |

**What is collected** (official builds, after you opt in): which feature/screen was opened, high-intent action counts, app version, OS/platform, install source, a daily active ping, and a random per-install UUID.

**What is *never* collected:** code, prompts, message/session content, file paths, project or repo names, branch names, environment variables, API keys, IP/geo, or anything tied to your identity. This is enforced by a **closed event schema in the type system** — an event physically cannot carry a path or prompt — not just by policy.

**Opt in** (takes effect immediately, reversible anytime):

```bash
export CLAUDE_VIEW_TELEMETRY=1      # or set it in your shell profile
```

…or use the toggle in **Settings → Telemetry**. Full detail: [claudeview.ai/privacy](https://claudeview.ai/privacy).

Why opt-in for official builds? Your machine is yours — no data leaves it unless you explicitly say so. If you choose to share anonymous, content-free usage counts, they guide what gets built (the same minimal model as Next.js, Astro, Homebrew and VS Code, but off until you opt in). Source builds never send at all.

---

## Installation

| Method | Command |
|--------|---------|
| **Shell** (macOS/Linux) | `curl -fsSL https://get.claudeview.ai/install.sh \| sh` |
| **PowerShell** (Windows) | `irm https://get.claudeview.ai/install.ps1 \| iex` |
| **npx** (all platforms) | `npx claude-view` |
| **Plugin** (auto-start) | `claude plugin marketplace add tombelieber/claude-view && claude plugin install claude-view` |

The shell installer downloads a pre-built binary (~10 MB), installs to `~/.claude-view/bin`, and adds it to your PATH. Then just run `claude-view`.

**Only requirement:** [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed.

<details>
<summary><strong>Configuration</strong></summary>
<br>

| Env Variable | Default | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_VIEW_PORT` or `PORT` | `47892` | Override the default port |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Self-Hosting & Local Dev</strong></summary>
<br>

The pre-built binary ships with auth, sharing, and mobile relay baked in. Building from source? These features are **opt-in via environment variables** — omit any and that feature is simply disabled.

| Env Variable | Feature | Without it |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Login / auth | Auth disabled — fully local, zero-account mode |
| `RELAY_URL` | Mobile pairing | QR pairing unavailable |
| `SHARE_WORKER_URL` + `SHARE_VIEWER_URL` | Encrypted sharing | Share button hidden |

```bash
bun dev    # fully local, no cloud dependencies
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Enterprise / Sandbox Environments</strong></summary>
<br>

If your machine restricts writes (DataCloak, CrowdStrike, corporate DLP):

```bash
cp crates/server/.env.example .env
# Uncomment CLAUDE_VIEW_DATA_DIR
```

This keeps database, prompt index, cache, and lock files inside the repo. Set `CLAUDE_VIEW_SKIP_HOOKS=1` to skip hook registration in read-only environments.

</details>

---

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>"Not signed in" banner showing even though I'm logged in</strong></summary>
<br>

claude-view checks your Claude credentials by reading `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (with macOS Keychain fallback). Try these steps:

1. **Verify Claude CLI auth:** `claude auth status`
2. **Check credentials file:** `cat ~/.claude/.credentials.json` — should have a `claudeAiOauth` section with an `accessToken`
3. **Check macOS Keychain:** `security find-generic-password -s "Claude Code-credentials" -w`
4. **Check token expiry:** Look at `expiresAt` in the credentials JSON — if past, run `claude auth login`
5. **Check HOME:** `echo $HOME` — the server reads from `$HOME/.claude/.credentials.json`

If all checks pass and the banner persists, report it on [Discord](https://discord.gg/G7wdZTpRfu).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What data does claude-view access?</strong></summary>
<br>

claude-view reads the JSONL session files that Claude Code writes to `~/.claude/projects/`. It indexes session metadata locally in SQLite and searches session text with rust grep over local JSONL files. **Your session content never leaves your machine** unless you explicitly use the encrypted sharing feature. Official builds (`npx claude-view` / install.sh) send **anonymous usage analytics** only after you opt in — which features/screens are opened, app version, OS, install source, a random per-install UUID — and **never** code, prompts, paths or session content; opt in with `CLAUDE_VIEW_TELEMETRY=1` or the Settings toggle. Builds from source contain no analytics key and send nothing. See [Privacy & Telemetry](#privacy--telemetry).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it work with Claude Code in VS Code / Cursor / IDE extensions?</strong></summary>
<br>

Yes. claude-view monitors all Claude Code sessions regardless of how they were started — terminal CLI, VS Code extension, Cursor, or Agent SDK. Each session shows a source badge (Terminal, VS Code, SDK) so you can filter by launch method.
